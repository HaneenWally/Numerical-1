Number of Inputs (5):
- X's of each point (X list)
- Y's of each point (Y list)
- Value of X you want the Derivative at
- Order of Approximation : Number of terms used in Approximation (Stopping Criteria)
- Approx.Error : Stop when error is less than Approx.Error(Stopping Criteria)

Number of Outputs (2):
- The result F'(X) (The Derivative at X)
- Approximation Error of the Derivative
